The upper right corner will show you the explanation of the object. The first view you have is the wall of the room you are facing. Click on the edges of the wall to change the current one. You can also click on the objects in order to get a closer look of them, or grabbing them in case they are items. All of the items you currently have will appear on the panel at the right side of the window.</h3>
	<h3 style="text-align: left; font-family: serif; font-size: 20px;">I made this game using all of my actual knowledge in programming, and I know it can be done better. If you have any suggestions for developing the game in a more efficient way, feel free to send me a message through Discord. I won't accept suggestions for new puzzles or about the plot, though. </h3>
	<h2> I hope you have fun! :D </h2>
